# CSpathways
Notebooks used for my UT course "CS Pathways". Feel free to pilfer, just give me a shout out?

This uses a .csv file downloaded from the Stanford Open Policing Project. You can find local data there, just be advised that the data labels are not standardized
I tried to make it as readable as possible. I chose Jupyter notebooks because they can be ran on chromebooks using Binder.
Please email me if you have any questions. joelawalsh@gmail.com

I will keep adding to this.

If you can't find local data, especiall BY RACE, by all means take it to the streets.
