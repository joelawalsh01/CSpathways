# CSpathways
Notebooks used for my UT course "CS Pathways". Feel free to pilfer, just give me a shout out?
CS Pathways is a class for College of Natural Science students who are also preservice teachers seeking to acquire a micro-credential in computer science.

This uses a .csv file downloaded from the Stanford Open Policing Project. You can find local data there, just be advised that the data labels are not standardized.
I tried to make it as readable as possible. I chose Jupyter notebooks because they can be ran on chromebooks using Binder.
Please email me if you have any questions. joelawalsh@gmail.com

I will keep adding to this.

If you can't find local data in the database, especially stop data by race, please by all means take it to the streets.
